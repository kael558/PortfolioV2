## Problem Statement

The project is motivated by two needs:

1. **Quick Information Access:** The ability to quickly get answers by calling or texting a number.
2. **Smart Home Control:** The need to manage smart home devices via voice commands.

## Solution

A voice assistant that can be accessed through phone calls or text messages. It combines several technologies to provide both information retrieval and smart home control.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python:** Core development language.
- **Twilio:** For phone call and text message integration.
- **Pipecat.ai:** Framework for coordinating AI services.
- **Deepgram:** Speech-to-text conversion.
- **Groq Language Model:** For natural language understanding and generation.
- **Microsoft Cognitive AI:** Text-to-speech conversion.
- **Bing Search API:** For web-based queries.
