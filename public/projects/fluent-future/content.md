## Problem Statement

Many immigrants arriving in Canada face significant language barriers, hindering their ability to integrate effectively into their new communities and pursue career opportunities. While traditional ESL programs and classes exist, they often present challenges:

1. Limited accessibility due to time constraints, location, and cost
2. Lack of personalization to individual learning paces and styles
3. Insufficient individual attention in large class settings
4. Inability to cater to specific professional or industry-related language needs

These limitations can slow down the integration process and potentially impact the overall success and well-being of newcomers in Canada.
