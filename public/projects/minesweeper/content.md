THis project was inspired by [ShipFast](https://shipfa.st/) which has had very successful sales. It is a re-usable template and guide to quickly create and launch new products.  It will have a step-by-step process to guide users in setting up their project. The template will include a basic frontend and backend structure, along with integrations for analytics, authentication, and payments. Users can customize the template to fit their needs and deploy it to Firebase hosting. 

This template is much cheaper than alternatives of Next.js and Vercel. It is also more flexible with Mobile Apps as Ionic UI is more mobile friendly. THe guide will include support for publishing Mobile apps to both Android and Apple.
